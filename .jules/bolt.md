## 2026-01-30 - [Efficient Type Comparison in get_dataset] **Learning:** Using a dplyr/purrr chain (enframe -> bind_rows -> group_by -> summarise) to identify inconsistent column types across a list of data frames is significantly slower than a base R pattern using do.call(c, ...), split(), and vapply(). The overhead of creating multiple intermediate tibbles becomes noticeable when dealing with many resources or columns. **Action:** Prefer base R flattening and grouping patterns for simple metadata comparisons across lists of objects.

## 2026-01-30 - [Handling Multi-class Objects in Type Checking] **Learning:** `purrr::map_chr(df, class)` fails on columns with multiple classes, such as `POSIXct` objects which have classes `c("POSIXct", "POSIXt")`. **Action:** Use `vapply(df, function(col) class(col)[1], character(1))` for more robust and performant type extraction in R.
