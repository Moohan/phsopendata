## 2026-01-31 - [httr2 vs httr URL escaping] **Learning:** `httr2::req_url_path` and `httr2::url_build` are more aggressive with escaping than `httr::modify_url`. For example, they escape `=` in path components, which can break legacy API expectations (like CKAN resource IDs in some tests). **Action:** Use `paste0` for path components that should not be escaped if they contain special characters intended to be literal, or ensure tests use realistic data (like UUIDs).
## 2026-01-31 - [Robust error handling with try()] **Learning:** Checking for specific error strings in a `try()` result without first checking `inherits(content, "try-error")` is dangerous and leads to "operator $ is invalid for atomic vectors" errors if an unexpected error occurs. **Action:** Always use `inherits(x, "try-error")` as the first check after a `try()` block.
