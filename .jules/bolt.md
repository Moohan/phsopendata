## 2025-05-15 - [Vectorized Context Addition and Type Resolution] **Learning:** Iterative context addition using `purrr::pmap` and `add_context` (which uses `mutate`) is a major bottleneck when fetching many resources in `get_dataset`. Vectorizing this after `list_rbind` yields ~45x speedup. Also, base R patterns for type resolution (`vapply`, `split`) and batch coercion (`lapply`) are significantly faster than their `purrr`/`dplyr` equivalents in this architecture. **Action:** Prefer vectorizing metadata addition after combining data frames and use base R patterns for batch operations on lists of data frames.
